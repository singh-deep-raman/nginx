// NGINX

* NGINX (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance, open-source web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache
* It is used for
    - Web server – serves static files like HTML, CSS, images
    - Reverse proxy – sits in front of backend apps (Java, Node, Python, etc.)
    - Load balancer – distributes traffic across multiple servers
    - API gateway – handles routing, SSL, rate limiting
    - Caching – speeds things up by caching responses

* We will talk about as Nginx as Load Balancer here
* Nginx uses round-robin algorithm to distribute the load among servers
